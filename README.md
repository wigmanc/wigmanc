### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wigman, and I tend to go down different rabbit holes learning new and other technologies.
However, I lack one crucial piece, and that is documentation, 
so I am throwing myself under the bus and at the same time forcing myself to document everything I work on.
Check periodically as I update all my notes from all my studies.
